# Consensus-From-Trust
For this work, I have designed and implemented a distributed consensus algorithm given a graph of
“trust” relationships between nodes. This is an alternative method of resisting sybil attacks and
achieving consensus; it has the benefit of not “wasting” electricity like proof-of-work does.
