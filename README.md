# Consensus-From-Trust
In this work I have implemented a node thatâ€™s part of a block-chain-based distributed consensus 
protocol. Specifically, the code will receive incoming transactions and blocks and maintain an
updated block chain.
The method does not require proof of work to reach consensus given some assumptions.

#Assumptions
The recieved transactions are all valid.
